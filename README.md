# verilog-TEA

This project is an implementation of Tiny Encryption Algorithm.
In wikipedia:

"In cryptography, the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) is a block cipher notable for its simplicity of description and implementation, typically a few lines of code. It was designed by David Wheeler and Roger Needham of the Cambridge Computer Laboratory; it was first presented at the Fast Software Encryption workshop in Leuven in 1994, and first published in the proceedings of that workshop.[4]
The cipher is not subject to any patents."

The provided files, are two verilog files and a cpp file. CPP file is taken from wikipedia and is not my work! I used that to test the correctness of my implementation!
